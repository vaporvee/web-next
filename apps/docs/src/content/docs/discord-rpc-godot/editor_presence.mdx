**Enabling it:**
<Steps>
1. Enable the DiscordRPC addon (and restart the editor like in the quickstart guide)
2. Go to the **editor** settings
3. and enable `"DiscordRPC/EditorPresence/enabled"`<br/> 
</Steps>
Editor Presence also updates a bit slower on client side. Your friends will see what you are doing in the exact second even when its not updated for you directly.

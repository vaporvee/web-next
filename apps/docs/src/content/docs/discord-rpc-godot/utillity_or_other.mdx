## Methods 
### Run callbacks
```gdscript ins={2}
func _process(_delta):
    DiscordRPC.run_callbacks()
```
This runs normaly inside the Autoload `DiscordRPCLoader` wich should be automatically added by the plugin. If not this needs to be added to use most features of the plugin. In older versions of the plguin known as `discord_sdk.run_callbacks()`.

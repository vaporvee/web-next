## Variables

Anything of course begins with `DiscordRPC.` e.g. `_godot DiscordRPC.app_id = #<your Application ID>`
### Rich presence

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app_id` | `int` | The Application ID you need to get to make anything in the plugin → https://discord.com/developers/applications |
| `details` | `String` | The first text line visible in the Activity (after the app name) |
| `state` | `String` | The second text line visible in the Activity |
| `large_image` | `String` | Key for the large image you set while uploading an image to the "Rich Presence" → "Art Assets" tab in your online Discord dev panel |
| `large_image_text` | `String` | Text wich shows when you hover over the large image |
| `small_image` | `String` | Key for the small image you set while uploading an image to the "Rich Presence" → "Art Assets" tab in your online Discord dev panel |
| `small_image_text` | `String` | Text wich shows when you hover over the small image |
| `start_timestamp` | `int` | The "02:46 elapsed" timestamp in the presence. Get the current time with Godot's `int(Time.get_unix_time_from_system())` and Discord counts in seconds from it |
| `end_timestamp` | `int` | The "59:59 elapsed" timestamp in the presence. Get it with Godot's `int(Time.get_unix_time_from_system())` and add seconds as int e.g. `+ 3600` → + 1 Hour |

### Invite system
The values can be pretty anything since there is no lobby system in the SDK anymore. You should already have a custom lobby system wich can compute the secret and change the values. After an invite every value should be the same as the other player.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `party_id` | `String` | Unique identifier for the party |
| `current_party_size` | `int` | The current playercount in the party |
| `max_party_size` | `int` | Maximum allowed playercount in the party |
| `match_secret` | `String` | Unique hash for the given match context |
| `join_secret` | `String ` | Unique hash for chat invites and Ask to Join |
| `spectate_secret` | `String` | Unique hash for Spectate button |
| `is_public_party` | `bool` | Turn it to `true` if you want people to join the party without asking. This needs to be enabled in the Discord user settings |
| `instanced` | `bool` | Whether this activity is an instanced context, like a match |

## Methods
### Refresh
After setting any variables you have to reload the RPC with this method
```gdscript
DiscordRPC.refresh()
```
### Clear
Disables the Activity.
```gdscript
DiscordRPC.clear(reset_values)
```
**Taken variable:** `bool reset_values` **Standard value:** `false`<br/>
When turning `reset_values` to `true` it completely clears the whole activity with its `app_id` and other values.

### Unclear
Reenables the before cleared Activity. Only works with `DiscordRPC.clear(reset_values = false)`(default).
```gdscript
DiscordRPC.unclear()
```

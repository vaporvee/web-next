## How to build
<Steps>
1. Clone the project
2. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Install scons via pip with
    ```sh
    pip install scons
    ```
    and make sure to put scons on your PATH or replace "scons" with a scons run command<br/>

4. Run this command 
    ```sh title="Setting up project source..."
    python setup.py
    ``` 
5. and build the project with 
    ```sh title="Building plugin for current platform..."
    python build.py 
    ``` 
    There is a prompt how it should start Godot (if `godot` is on
    PATH) to test the addon fast directly.

    **or** run
    ```sh title="Building for DEBUG Godot project exports..."
    scons
    ```
    and
    ```sh title="Building for RELEASE Godot project exports..."
    scons target=template_release
    ```
6. Now the addon should be installed in the project folder of the repo and can be exported with
    ```sh title="Exporting zip and plugin demos..."
    python release.py
    ```
</Steps>

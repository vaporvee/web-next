:::danger[Important plugin explaination]
**This is for the Discord Game SDK NOT the Embedded App SDK** <br/>
Any mention of "SDK" has nothing to do with making Discord voice channel activities. <br/>
Its only to display your game in a Discord user's profile with extra information and some other features.
:::

:::note[Discord Game SDK information]
The GameSDK's Achievements, Applications, Voice, Images, Lobbies, Networking, Storage, and Store (purchases and discounts) features have been deprecated and will not be added. <br /> However the rest is and will still be supported by Discord.
:::
<br />
:::tip[Keep in mind] 
To make anything work in the plugin, make sure to run:
```gdscript
func _process(_delta):
    DiscordRPC.run_callbacks()
```

This happens normally inside the Autoload which should be automatically added by the plugin.<br />
Something that does **not get added automatically** is your `app_id`. It is also mandatory to be able to use anything in the plugin.

```gdscript
DiscordRPC.app_id = #<your Application ID>
```

## Quick start

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Recommended">
    <Steps>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the AssetLib tab in your Godot Editor.</li>
        <li>
          Search for "discord" and install all the files from this plugin
          <img width="30px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaporvee/discord-rpc-godot/main/project/assets/Logo_V2_Clyde.png"/>
        </li>
        <LastQuickSteps />
      </ol>
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Manual">
    <Steps>
      <ol>
        <li>
        <LinkButton href="https://github.com/vaporvee/discord-rpc-godot/releases/latest/download/ADDON-discord-rpc-godot.zip/"  icon="document" iconPlacement="start">Download the addon</LinkButton>
        </li>
        <li>
		Copy the folder from the zip file to the root of your Godot project like the following
		<FileTree>
		- **addons/**
		  - **discord-rpc-gd/** should contain this folder with these files
		    - bin/
			- nodes/
		    - ...
		    - plugin.cfg
		    - plugin.gd
		    - ...
		    - restart_window.tscn
		    - ...
		- …
		- icon.svg
		- project.godot
		</FileTree>
		</li>
        <LastQuickSteps />
      </ol>
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```gdscript 
extends Node
func _ready():
DiscordRPC.app_id = 1099618430065324082 # Application ID
DiscordRPC.details = "A demo activity by vaporvee"
DiscordRPC.state = "Checkpoint 23/23"
DiscordRPC.large_image = "example_game" # Image key from "Art Assets"
DiscordRPC.large_image_text = "Try it now!"
DiscordRPC.small_image = "boss" # Image key from "Art Assets"
DiscordRPC.small_image_text = "Fighting the end boss! D:"

DiscordRPC.start_timestamp = int(Time.get_unix_time_from_system()) # "02:46 elapsed"
# DiscordRPC.end_timestamp = int(Time.get_unix_time_from_system()) + 3600 # +1 hour in unix time / "01:00:00 remaining"

DiscordRPC.refresh() # Always refresh after changing the values!
```
**Then it will look similar to this:**

## Troubleshooting
First of all try reinstalling the plugin and restart both your Godot Editor and your Discord client. Or try to install the demo above and see if it works. If you still have problems, check the following:
<details><summary><b>I did everything right got no error but the Discord RPC Activity still doesn't show up.</b></summary>
Check that `Discord Settings -> Activity Privacy -> Share your detected activities with others` is eneabled in your Discord client.<br/> ![Discord Settings Screenshot](/images/discord-activity-setting-screenshot.webp)</details>
<details><summary><b>I have no errors in my Godot console from the plugin but my Activity doesn't show up in my Discord Client.</b></summary>Make sure a `DiscordSDK.run_callbacks()` function runs in a `_process(delta)` function. This should happen in the Autoload added by the plugin.</details>
<details>
<summary><b>I have a lot of `DiscordSDK not declared` errors spammed in my Godot Console and i can't use the plugin.</b></summary> Make sure the plugin is actually enabled. Then the plugin should work and after the second restart you shouldn't get any errors from the plugin. But if it still gives you the errors delete this `.gdignore` file in your file explorer (will not be shown in the Godot Editor)
<FileTree>
- addons/
  - discord-rpc-gd/
	- bin/
      - **.gdignore**
  	- …
- …
- icon.svg
- project.godot
</FileTree>
and restart the editor manually.

<details>
<summary><b>I downloaded Discord via Flatpak and it doesn't work.</b></summary>
You can enable Rich Presence support by creating a symlink for a file Discord uses for RPC communication. You can see instructions on how to do that <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Discord#Enabling_rich_presence_on_Flatpak">here</a>.
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>I can't get my game working with this plugin on a platform which isn't supported by it.</b></summary>
You would need to disable the plugin (that means never instantiate a scene containing its code). You do that with a custom manager. Here is a good example:
```gdscript
func is_discord_rpc_supported() -> bool:
    return game_platform == GamePlatform.PC and GDExtensionManager.is_extension_loaded("res://addons/discord-rpc-gd/bin/discord-rpc-gd.gdextension")

func _init_discord_rpc():
    if not is_discord_rpc_supported():
        return
    var discord_rich_presence_scene: PackedScene = load("res://scenes/integration/discord_rich_presence.tscn")
    discord_rich_presence = discord_rich_presence_scene.instantiate()
    add_child(discord_rich_presence)
    discord_rich_presence.initialize()
    ```
</details>
